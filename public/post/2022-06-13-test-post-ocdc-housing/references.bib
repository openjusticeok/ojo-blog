	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study assessed relationships between homelessness, mental disorder, and incarceration. METHODS: Using archival databases that included all 12,934 individuals who entered the San Francisco County Jail system during the first six months of 2000, the authors assessed clinical and behavioral characteristics associated with homelessness and incarceration. RESULTS: In 16 percent of the episodes of incarceration, the inmates were homeless, and in 18 percent of the episodes, the inmates had a diagnosis of a mental disorder; 30 percent of the inmates who were homeless had a diagnosis of a mental disorder during one or more episodes. Seventy-eight percent of the homeless inmates with a severe mental disorder had co-occurring substance-related disorders. Inmates with dual diagnoses were more likely to be homeless and to be charged with violent crimes than other inmates. Multiple regression analyses showed that inmates who were homeless and had co-occurring severe mental disorders and substance-related disorders were held in jail longer than other inmates who had been charged with similar crimes. CONCLUSIONS: People who were homeless and who were identified as having mental disorders, although representing only a small proportion of the total population, accounted for a substantial proportion of persons who were incarcerated in the criminal justice system in this study's urban setting. The increased duration of incarceration associated with homelessness and co-occurring severe mental disorders and substance-related disorders suggests that jails are de facto assuming responsibility for a population whose needs span multiple service delivery systems.},

	abstract = {A sizable group of individuals in the United States cycle in and out of jails, prisons, mental health hospitals, homeless shelters, and other expensive public institutions over time. This little-studied population represents significant unmet need and the inadequacy of services for complex consumers. The current study examined a sample (N = 161) of chronically homeless frequent utilizers of jail and mental health systems in Chicago, Illinois. Cluster analysis was used to differentiate the sample into four reliable subgroups based on measures for prior homelessness, jail incarcerations, mental health hospitalizations, poor current mood, and limitations due to physical health. Logistic regression revealed that clusters differed significantly on reincarceration at 6 months postrelease. Implications for programming and policy for each cluster are discussed, including suggestions for targeting services to distinguishing characteristics for each subgroup. These findings argue for the importance of coordinating efforts across services systems to better identify and serve shared clients.},

	abstract = {Background
Project-based Housing First (HF) programs provide immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based supportive housing to chronically homeless people within a single housing project. Previous studies have shown project-based HF is associated with 6-month reductions in jail time (Larimer et al., 2009), and that people with criminal histories are able to maintain their housing in supportive housing, such as project-based HF (Malone, 2009, Tsai and Rosenheck, 2012). This study aimed to extend these findings to document the criminal histories of project-based HF residents and to test the associations among exposure to project-based HF, criminal histories and jail time over a 2-year follow-up.
Methods
Participants (N=95) were chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems who moved into project-based HF. Measures included administrative data on criminal history, project-based HF exposure, and jail days and bookings for two-years prior to and subsequent to move into project-based HF.
Results
The majority of all past criminal convictions were misdemeanors (91.3\%). Further, criminal convictions did not predict participants’ housing retention in project-based HF. Months of project-based HF exposure – not prior criminal histories – predicted significant decreases in jail days and bookings from the two years prior and subsequent to participants’ move into HF.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that participants’ criminal histories primarily reflect “symptoms” of homelessness rather than threats to public safety. Further, the extent of participants’ criminal histories was not associated with subsequent jail time or housing attrition. Although causation cannot be implied, these findings show that the amount of time spent in project-based HF is associated with decreased jail time for up to two years following initial HF exposure.},
