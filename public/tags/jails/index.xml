          1. The Oklahoma County Detention Center Located in Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma County Detention Center (OCDC) is the biggest jail in the state, currently incarcerating an average of around 1,500-1,600 people. It used to be much bigger – in 2016, the jail’s population peaked at over 2,500 people, X% the jail’s original intended capacity – but reform efforts undertaken in the last few years have successfully begun to reverse this upward trend.
