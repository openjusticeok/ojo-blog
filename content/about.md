# What is OJO?

Open Justice Oklahoma (OJO) is a criminal justice research nonprofit that seeks to improve understanding of our justice system through analysis of public data. Working closely with justice system stakeholders and advocates, we use cutting-edge methods to identify problems, craft solutions, and measure reform outcomes. Our goal is to provide all Oklahomans with a more complete understanding of how our justice system operates and how we can use it to reduce crime, protect public safety, and improve rehabilitation.

# What does OJO do?

OJO gathers, cleans, and standardizes data from various sources, including jail, court, and corrections records. We use that data to produce analyses and tools for several different audiences:

* Public data tools that allow advocates, journalists, and the public to understand broad trends in local justice systems,
* Stakeholder tools that provide insights to allow prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys, and others to understand the effects of their policies and practices, and
* Practitioner tools that help justice-related nonprofits and others to refine their approaches to rehabilitation.

# What policy areas does OJO focus on?

We study the criminal justice system in its entirety, from arrest to release.
