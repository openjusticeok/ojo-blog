The % of the population[^1] in the Oklahoma County Detention Center listed as homeless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

Unlike prisons, local jails like the Oklahoma County Detention Center (OCDC) mostly hold people for short periods of time, either in the immediate aftermath of an arrest or while a person is awaiting their day in court. At any given time, around 80-85% of the population in OCDC is pre-trial (and thus has not yet been convicted of any crime). Those who are unable to pay bail are far more likely to remain incarcerated, and as a result a significant portion of the people held in local jails are homeless or have dealt with homelessness in the past.

Data from OCDC shows that this problem is very prevalent in Oklahoma County – in the biggest and deadliest[^2] jail in the state, nearly one in five of the people incarcerated are homeless. Jails are not supposed to function as homeless shelters, but this data demonstrates how often people with nowhere else to go end up in a cell.

- One large-scale national study found that around 15.3% of people held in all U.S. jails were homeless throughout the year before their incarceration ([Greg A. Greenberg and Robert A. Rosenheck 2008](#ref-greg_a__greenberg_jail_2008)), meaning that homelessness was 7.5-11.3 times as common among jail inmates as among the general population. As for why this is the case, the researchers note that unhoused people in local jails are “more likely to have past criminal justice system involvement for both nonviolent and violent offenses and to have mental health and substance abuse problems and a lack of personal assets”. They also note that property crimes (including things like trespassing and loitering, petty theft, etc.) were particularly common among unhoused inmates, suggesting that their “incarceration may have resulted from ‘survival behavior’”. Is locking these people up over and over again really the best solution for our community?

- Another large study found similar rates of homelessness in the San Francisco County Jail system, concluding that people struggling with homelessness made up roughly 16% of all incidents of incarceration ([McNiel, Binder, and Robinson 2005](#ref-mcniel_incarceration_2005)). Tellingly, they also found that diagnosed but untreated mental health issues were substantially more common among inmates facing homelessness as compared to the population as a whole (30% vs. 18%, respectively), and that 78% of those who were facing both homelessness and mental health crises were *also* facing substance-related disorders at the same time. Put simply, research like this makes it clear that a significant proportion of the population in local jails like OCDC are there not because they set out to commit crimes and endanger public safety, but because their own lives have been severely disrupted by homelessness, addiction, poverty, and/or mental health issues that they can’t afford or are unable to get treated. Further research has shown that treating these underlying issues (using a “housing first” or similar approach) can have dramatically positive effects on incarceration and recidivism rates ([Clifasefi, Malone, and Collins 2013](#ref-clifasefi_exposure_2013)).

People dealing with homelessness are at a significantly higher risk of being incarcerated, particularly for low-level property crimes. This is true in Oklahoma County as well, and the data reflect that our criminal justice system criminalizes homelessness, with the aim of moving the people suffering out of the public and into the jail, where they will languish out of sight and out of mind. The research linking homelessness, poverty, mental health, and substance abuse to incarceration also suggests that we would be better off taking these people to a place where they can receive treatment, resources, and help rather than a jail cell that will likely make things worse and increase the chances of recidivism.
