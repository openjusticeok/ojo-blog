# Use our data in your justice work

OJO offers data and consulting services to organizations and individuals who share our vision for a justice system that is equitable, open, and rehabilitative. We’ve worked with organizations on projects dealing with both criminal and civil matters. These include:

- An examination of the racial disparities in the enforcement of child neglect statutes
- An alert tracking the women booked into the Tulsa County jail
- An examination of the factors in an eviction case most often associated with a judgement against a tenant

If data you can help you support Oklahomans involved in the justice system, please get in touch with us.

## Services

Open Justice Oklahoma maintains a vast database of justice-system related records from agencies across the state. The main sources are:

- Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) court records
- Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) prison and probation records
- Tulsa and Oklahoma County jail records

Our data provides granular detail about who is involved in the justice system, how courts process cases, and who ends up incarcerated for how long. We have information on millions of civil and criminal cases filed in District Courts since 2000, including issues, charges, dispositions, case processing times, hearings and events, and much more.

## Data Extracts

We offer portions of the data in raw format for free, as well as cleaned, ready-to-analyze data for purchase. If you have questions about what is available in our database, please reach out and ask.

Our database contains a massive amount of information that requires care and expertise to make sense of. Our analysts will sift through the data to find what you’re looking for, then produce a research brief.

Examples: 
How many people charged with assault and battery are put on probation?
How many people have their fines and fees sent to a private collections company, and how many have their tax refunds intercepted?
20+
Custom report (new or existing data, multiple sources)
Often, we need to connect data within our database or gather new data to answer questions. We will work with you to find the data you need, connect it with our data, and analyze it thoroughly and purposefully.

Examples:
How many people currently in prison were revoked from DA supervision?
What are the demographic and geographic patterns of people imprisoned for child neglect?
40+
